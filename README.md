 # Proposed Solution 

1. Structured Irrigation System: Divide farmland into sections, using sensors to deliver precise water amounts through smart pumps.

2. Smart Rover for Crop Health: Deploy an ML-based rover to detect plant health issues and send real-time alerts.
3. ML-Driven Crop Management: Implement machine learning for real-time detection, prevention, and avoidance of crop diseases.

4. Mobile Application Integration: Provide farmers with real-time alerts and recommendations through a user-friendly mobile app.

UNIQUENESS :The solution integrates IoT, machine learning, and robotics into a single system for precision farming with real-time data and mobile access. The rover design emphasizes a modular, robust structure with advanced sensors, efficient power management, and an intuitive user interface.

# Feasibility : 
Our model is practical and realistic because it uses proven IoT and machine learning technology with easy to access mobile interface.
It’s designed to be adaptable, making it practical for farms of various sizes.

# Challenges :
The initial setup can be quite pricey but still most of the farmers can afford it.
Farmers need to learn how to use the new technology.

# Strategies : 
We can seek government support or grants to ease the financial burden.
We’ll offer simple, hands-on guides and friendly support to help farmers get started.

# Impacts : 
Enhanced water efficiency and crop yield.
Early detection and prevention of crop diseases.

# Benefits : 
Economic: Reduces water usage and increases farm productivity.
Environmental: Conserves water and promotes sustainable farming practices.
Social: Improves farmers’ livelihood by optimizing resource use.
