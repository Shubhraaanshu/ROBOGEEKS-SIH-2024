 # Proposed Solution 

1. Structured Irrigation System: Divide farmland into sections, using sensors to deliver precise water amounts through smart pumps.

2. Smart Rover for Crop Health: Deploy an ML-based rover to detect plant health issues and send real-time alerts.
3. ML-Driven Crop Management: Implement machine learning for real-time detection, prevention, and avoidance of crop diseases.

4. Mobile Application Integration: Provide farmers with real-time alerts and recommendations through a user-friendly mobile app.

UNIQUENESS :The solution integrates IoT, machine learning, and robotics into a single system for precision farming with real-time data and mobile access. The rover design emphasizes a modular, robust structure with advanced sensors, efficient power management, and an intuitive user interface.
